Random 2
========

This package provides a Python 3 ported version of Python 2.7's ``random``
module. It has also been back-ported to work in Python 2.6.

In Python 3, the implementation of ``randrange()`` was changed, so that even
with the same seed you get different sequences in Python 2 and 3. Note that
several high-level functions such as ``randint()`` and ``choice()`` use
``randrange()``.

In my testing code I heavily rely on stable random generator results and it
makes porting code to Python 3 a lot harder, if all those tests have to be
adjusted. This package fixes that.
